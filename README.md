## Brute Force Method Applied to a Selected Encryption Method

This project was completed as part of the course **Parallel and Distributed Systems** and focused on applying the brute force method against a chosen encryption algorithm using CUDA architecture.

### Project Goal

- **Speeding Up Parallel Code**: To demonstrate that parallel execution using CUDA architecture can significantly accelerate program performance.  
- **Efficiency Analysis**: To show how the efficiency and acceleration of the brute force algorithm change depending on the number of threads used in computations.

### Summary

Increasing the number of threads reduces the time required to find passwords and increases speedup. However, after an initial increase, efficiency begins to decline. This aligns with Amdahlâ€™s law, which states that the speedup of a parallel program is limited by the time needed to launch new threads and allocate resources.

The experiments described in this report confirm that CUDA technology allows very efficient use of GPU computing power. Parallel code can significantly speed up time-consuming calculations.
